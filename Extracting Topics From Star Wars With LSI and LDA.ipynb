          "Wait a minute, where are you going?",
          "Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..",
          "That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.",
          "Did I hear a young noise blast through here?",
          "It was just Wormie on another rampage.",
          "I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?",
          "Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. ",
          "The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?",
          "I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!",
          "There they are!",
          "But there was a lot of firing earlier...",
          "I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...",
          "you anything.",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.",
          "What a desolate place this is.",
          "Where are you going?",
          "What makes you think there are settlements over there?",
          "And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.",
          "That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.",
          "... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.",
          "You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.",
          "Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...",
          "Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.",
          "Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.",
          "I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...",
          "My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.",
          "I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. ",
          "I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.",
          "Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.",
          "Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.",
          "I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.",
          "I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.",
          "Things always change.",
          "I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? ",
          "Look, sir - droids.",
          "Do you think they'll melt us down?",
          "It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.",
          "I have no need for a protocol droid.",
          "Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...",
          "What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.",
          "Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...",
          "Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...",
          "Uncle Owen...",
          "This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!",
          "Hey, what're you trying to push on us?",
          "Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.",
          "Uncle Owen...",
          "What about that one?",
          "Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.",
          "Okay, let's go.",
          "Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!",
          "It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!",
          "I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.",
          "Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.",
          "You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?",
          "That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.",
          "Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.",
          "Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...",
          "What's this?",
          "Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.",
          "Who is she?  She's beautiful.",
          "I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...",
          "Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.",
          "He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",
          "I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?",
          "Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.",
          "I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.",
          "H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.",
          "There you go.",
          "Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.",
          "been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! ",
          "Just you reconsider playing that message for him.",
          "You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",
          "What makes you think that?",
          "I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.",
          "That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.",
          "He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.",
          "I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.",
          "Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.",
          "Sure, there're more than enough droids.",
          "But it's a whole 'nother year.",
          "Look, it's only one more season.",
          "Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.",
          "Where are you going?",
          "It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.",
          "Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.",
          "Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.",
          "It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.",
          "Oh, no!",
          "That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. ",
          "How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!",
          "Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?",
          "It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.",
          "You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.",
          "Oh, he excels at that, sir.",
          "He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.",
          "Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?",
          "I think so.",
          "Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.",
          "Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...",
          "Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.",
          "Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?",
          "Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.",
          "If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.",
          "No, he's not going to try anything.",
          "What's wrong with him now?",
          "Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.",
          "There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.",
          "Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.",
          "Don't worry, he'll be all right.",
          "Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.",
          "Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?",
          "I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.",
          "Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.",
          "You know him!",
          "I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.",
          "Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...",
          "I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.",
          "No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?",
          "No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.",
          "That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.",
          "I wish I'd known him.",
          "He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...",
          "I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",
          "Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.",
          "What is it?",
          "An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.",
          "I seem to have found it.",
          "Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.",
          "I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.",
          "That's your uncle talking.",
          "Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?",
          "Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.",
          "The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....",
          "That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?",
          "They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.",
          "Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?",
          "Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!",
          "Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.",
          "How long have you had these droids?",
          "They're for sale if you want them.",
          "Let me see your identification.",
          "These are not the droids we're looking for.",
          "He can go about his business.",
          "You can go about your business.",
          "Move along.",
          "Move along.  Move along.",
          "I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.",
          "Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?",
          "Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.",
          "What?",
          "He doesn't like you.",
          "Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.",
          "This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.",
          "I don't like the look of this.",
          "Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.",
          "Should I have?",
          "I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?",
          "Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.",
          "What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?",
          "Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.",
          "Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.",
          "But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?",
          "You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...",
          "We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",
          "Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.",
          "Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.",
          "Going somewhere, Solo?",
          "Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.",
          "Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?",
          "You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.",
          "Over my dead body.",
          "I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.",
          "You watch your language!",
          "He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they ",
          "It will be enough.",
          "If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.",
          "Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.",
          "You sent Greedo to blast me.",
          "Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.",
          "I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.",
          "Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.",
          "You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.",
          "Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",
          "Blast 'em!",
          "Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.",
          "It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.",
          "Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.",
          "Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!",
          "How long before you can make the jump to light speed?",
          "What's that flashing?",
          "Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!",
          "What?",
          "You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. ",
          "No!",
          "Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.",
          "Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.",
          "But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.",
          "That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.",
          "I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.",
          "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",
          "It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.",
          "With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?",
          "You see, you can do it.",
          "In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.",
          "Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.",
          "Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.",
          "You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.",
          "That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.",
          "Yes.",
          "I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.",
          "Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.",
          "What's going on?",
          "What?  How?",
          "Maybe they know what happened.",
          "It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.",
          "Not for long...",
          "Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...",
          "Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.",
          "Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.",
          "I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.",
          "I have a very bad feeling about this.",
          "We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!",
          "Yes.",
          "Did you find any droids?",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...",
          "I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.",
          "Leave that to me!",
          "Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!",
          "Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?",
          "Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?",
          "You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.",
          "Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.",
          "I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.",
          "I want to go with you.",
          "But he can...",
          "Where did you dig up that old fossil?",
          "Ben is a great man.",
          "Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.",
          "I didn't hear you give any ideas...",
          "Who do you think...",
          "What is it?",
          "Well, who... who has he found?",
          "The princess?  She's here?",
          "Where... where is she?",
          "Princess?  What's going on?",
          "The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.",
          "Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.",
          "But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?",
          "They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. ",
          "But they're going to kill her!",
          "She's rich.",
          "Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...",
          "What?",
          "I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!",
          "You will...",
          "What's your plan?",
          "Okay.  Han, you put these on.",
          "Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.",
          "That isn't very reassuring.",
          "I can't see a thing in this helmet.",
          "This is not going to work.",
          "Why didn't you say so before?",
          "Where are you taking this... thing?",
          "Look out!  He's loose!",
          "He's going to pull us all apart.",
          "Go get him!",
          "Who is this?  What's your operating number?",
          "Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!",
          "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?",
          "You're who?",
          "I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.",
          "He is here...",
          "A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.",
          "Surely he must be dead by now.",
          "The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.",
          "Yes.",
          "Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.",
          "Get behind me!  Get behind me!",
          "Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.",
          "Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.",
          "Yes sir?",
          "We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!",
          "Oh, no!",
          "There isn't any other way out.",
          "This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?",
          "He's the brains, sweetheart.",
          "Well, I didn't...",
          "Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy.",
          "Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...",
          "No!  wait!",
          "Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.",
          "Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.",
          "That's your imagination.",
          "Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?",
          "What?",
          "Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.",
          "Where?",
          "Anywhere!  Oh!!",
          "I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...",
          "Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.",
          "Wait a minute!",
          "Take over!See to him!  Look there!",
          "Get to the top!",
          "I can't ",
          "One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!",
          "Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?",
          "Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!",
          "No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!",
          "Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!",
          "Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?",
          "Where are you going?",
          "No, wait.  They'll hear!",
          "Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?",
          "Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!",
          "It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?",
          "Do you know what's going on?",
          "What was that?",
          "There she is.",
          "You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.",
          "It's them!  Blast them!",
          "I think we took a wrong turn.",
          "Oh, I think I just blasted it.",
          "Where could they be?",
          "Open the blast doors!  Open the blast doors!",
          "When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.",
          "Only a master of evil, Darth.",
          "Your powers are weak, old man.",
          "Didn't we just leave this party?",
          "We ran into some old friends.",
          "Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.",
          "Look!",
          "Come on, Artoo, we're going!",
          "No!",
          "Blast the door!  Kid!",
          "I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!",
          "I can't believe he's gone.",
          "There wasn't anything you could have done.",
          "You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!",
          "You hear me, baby?  Hold together!",
          "There are still two more of them out there!",
          "That's it!  We did it!",
          "We did it!",
          "Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.",
          "They have just made the jump into hyperspace.",
          "You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.",
          "Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.",
          "At least the information in Artoo is still intact.",
          "What's so important?  What's he carrying?",
          "Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.",
          "So... what do you think of her, Han?",
          "Good...",
          "Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...",
          "No!",
          "You're safe!  We had feared the worst.",
          "Yes.",
          "Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?",
          "That's impossible, even for a computer.",
          "So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?",
          "That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.",
          "Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.",
          "What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.",
          "What's wrong?",
          "Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. ",
          "He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.",
          "Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!",
          "Thank you, sir.  I'll try.",
          "I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.",
          "You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!",
          "This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?",
          "Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?",
          "Okay, easy she goes!",
          "You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?",
          "Look at the size of that thing!",
          "I see it.  Stay low. ",
          "I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.",
          "Luke, let me know when you're going in.",
          "Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way.",
          "Biggs!  You've picked one up... watch it!",
          "I can't see it!  Where is he?!",
          "He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.",
          "Blast it!  Wedge where are you?",
          "Good shooting, Wedge!",
          "How many guns do you think, Gold Five?",
          "Stabilize your rear deflectors.  Watch for enemy fighters.",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "They came from behind....",
          "We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.  Should I have your ship standing by?",
          "Evacuate?  In out moment of triumph?  I think you overestimate their chances!",
          "This is it!",
          "Keep your eyes open for those fighters!",
          "No sign of any... wait!",
          "I see them.",
          "Almost there!",
          "Almost there!",
          "Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.",
          "... oh-five; we'll cover for you.",
          "Stay there...",
          "Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle.",
          "It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.",
          "We'll stay back far enough to cover you.",
          "Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!",
          "Get clear, Wedge.",
          "You can't do any more good back there!",
          "Let him go!  Stay on the leader!",
          "Wait!",
          "Nothing.  I'm all right.",
          "I have you now.",
          "What?",
          "Look out!",
          "You're all clear, kid.",
          "Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million.",
          "Hey!  Hey!",
          "Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.",
          "Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.",
          "Oh, no!",
          "Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me?  Say something!You can repair him, can't you?",
          "You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them."

          "I've told you kids to slow down!",
          "Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?",
          "Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.",
          "Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!",
          "I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. ",
          "What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!",
          "I've missed you kid.",
          "Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!",
          "Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.",
          "Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.",
          "Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!",
          "All right; shut up! I'll take this one.",
          "Yeah?",
          "Yeah?",

          "You mean the next semester before harvest?",
          "Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.",
          "I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.",
          "What are you doing hiding there?",

          "You must do what you feel is right, of course.",
          "The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.",
          "I find your lack of faith disturbing.",
          "It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.",
          "These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.",
          "And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.",
          "Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.",
          "The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.",

          "That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.",
          "Yes, I'll bet you have.",
          "What do you mean?",
          "With pleasure.",

          "We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.",
          "All right, men.  Load your weapons!",
          "Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?",
          "Are you all right?  What's wrong?",
          "You'd better get on with your exercises.",
          "Now be careful, Artoo.",
          "Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.",
          "You mean it controls your actions?",
          "Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.",
          "I call it luck. ",

          "What do you mean?  Where is it?",
          "It's an Imperial fighter.",
          "But there's gotta be something you can do!",
          "Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.",
          "Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.",
          "There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.",
          "Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.",
          "The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.",
          "Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.",
          "Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.",
          "Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.",
          "Boy you said it, Chewie.",
          "Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...",
          "Oh, no!  We've got to do something.",
          "Better her than me...",
          "Rich?",
          "You'll get it!",
          "I better!",
          "All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!",
          "All right.",
          "Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?",
          "Lock the door!",
          "I did say so before!",
          "I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.",
          "We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.",
          "Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?",
          "We're sending a squad up.",
          "If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.",
          "There's something alive in here!",
          "I've got a very bad feeling about this.",
          "Follow me!  You stand guard.",
          "All right.",
          "We've had some problems...",
          "Threepio, we're all right!",
          "We're all right.  You did great.",
          "Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.",
          "If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.",
          "No reward is worth this.",
          "Give me regular reports.",
          "We're right above you.  Stand by.",
          "There's no lock!",
          "Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the control that extends the bridge.",
          "For luck!",
          "You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.",
          "Is the ship all right?",
          "We've lost lateral controls.",
          "Got him!  I got him!",
          "Are they away?",
          "You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!",
          "I care!",
          "Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!",
          "All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?",
          "Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...",
          "I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.",
          "I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?",
          "Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.",
          "All wings report in.",
          "We're passing through their magnetic field.",
          "Hold tight!",
          "Heavy fire, boss!  Twenty-threedegrees.",
          "Are you all right?",
          "Watch yourself!  There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.",
          "Got him!",
          "Artoo, see what you can do with it.  Hang on back there.",
          "There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?",
          "I'd say about twenty guns.  Some on the surface, some on the towers.",
          "I'll take them myself!  Cover me!",
          "Loosen up!",
          "Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.",
          "Rendezvous at mark six point one.",
          "There's too much interference!",
          "Just hold them off for a few seconds.",
          "You'd better let her loose.",
          "It's away!",
          "Red Leader, we're right above you.  Turn to point...",
          "... I just lost my starboard engine.",
          "Right with you, boss.",
          "What about that tower?",
          "Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!  See if you can't lock it down!",
          "Hang on, Artoo!",
          "The Force is strong with this one!",
          "I've lost Artoo!",
          "You may fire when ready.",
          "Remember, the Force will be with you... always.",
          "I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!",
          "We'll get to work on him right away.",

          "Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.",
          "You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!",
          "Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.",
          "I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!",
          "Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.",
          "She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.",
          "Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?",
          "It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.",
          "Then I guess I won't see you.",
          "Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. ",
          "We're doomed.",
          "But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...",

          "Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!",
          "What happened?",
          "Quickly, son... they're on the move.",
          "A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",
          "Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.",
          "Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.",
          "Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!",
          "The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.",
          "And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.",
          "The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.",
          "Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!",
          "Enough of this!  Vader, release him!",
          "This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.",
          "If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!",
          "And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.",
          "About three or four seasons.",
          "Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.",
          "Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?",
          "It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!",
          "Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!",
          "Seventeen, huh!",
          "Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.",
          "Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.",
          "Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.",
          "The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?",
          "I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.",
          "I expected you would be.",
          "Which way?",
          "Stop that ship!",
          "Here's where the fun begins!",
          "It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.",
          "Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...",
          "Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.",
          "to take the responsibility yourself!",
          "Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",
          "The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.",
          "Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",
          "You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!",
          "I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?",
          "Dantooine.",
          "They're on Dantooine.",
          "There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",
          "I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.",
          "This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.",
          "Stretch out with your feelings.",
          "Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.",
          "Terminate her... immediately!",
          "Destroyed... by the Empire!",
          "The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...",
          "There's another ship coming in.",
          "It followed us!",
          "No.  It's a short range fighter.",
          "It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.",
          "A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.",
          "That's no moon!  It's a space station.",

          "You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.",
          "To your stations!",
          "Close all outboard shields!  Close all outboard shields!",
          "We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.",
          "They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.",
          "Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.",
          "Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!",
          "He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.",
          "The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.",
          "Princess Leia.",
          "Princess?",
          "Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.",
          "Everything is under control.  Situation normal.",
          "What happened?",
          "Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.",
          "The princess!  Put all sections on alert!",
          "Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.",
          "Can't get out that way.",
          "I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.",
          "What the hell are you doing?",
          "What happened?",
          "They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.",
          "They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.",
          "Secure this area until the alert is canceled.",
          "Maybe it's another drill.",
          "For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.",
          "Get back to the ship!",
          "He certainly has courage.",
          "They're coming through!",
          "Close the blast doors!",
          "We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!",
          "They're coming in too fast!",
          "Oooh!",
          "That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.",
          "Easy... you call that easy?",
          "Not this ship, sister.",
          "The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!",
          "We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.",
          "We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.",
          "The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.",
          "Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.",
          "The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.",
          "Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.",
          "It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.",
          "Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.",
          "All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.",
          "What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.",
          "Stand-by alert.  Death Star approaching.  Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.",
          "Lock S-foils in attack position.",
          "Switch your deflectors on.",
          "Double front!",
          "Accelerate to attack speed.  This is it, boys!",
          "We're starting for the target shaft now.",
          "We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!",
          "We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.",
          "Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.",
          "Watch your back!  Fighter's above you, coming in!",
          "The exhaust post is...",
          "Switch power to front deflection screens.",
          "Death Star will be in range in five minutes. ",
          "The guns... they've stopped!",
          "They've coming in!  Three marks at two ten.",
          "I can't maneuver!",
          "Stay on target.",
          "We're too close.",
          "Stay on target!",
          "Rebel base, three minutes and closing.",
          "We should be able to see it by now.",
          "Coming in point three five.",
          "Target's coming up!",
          "Close up formation.",

          "My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!  Are you sure the computer can hit it?",
          "You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!",
          "Artoo, try and increase the power!",
          "Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.",
          "The Death Star has cleared the planet.  The Death Star has cleared the planet.",

Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.\", \"There you go.\", \"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.\", \"been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! \", \"Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\", \"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\", \"What makes you think that?\", \"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.\", \"That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.\", \"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.\", \"I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\", \"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\", \"Sure, there're more than enough droids.\", \"But it's a whole 'nother year.\", \"Look, it's only one more season.\", \"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\", \"Where are you going?\", \"It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.\", \"Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.\", \"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.\", \"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\", \"Oh, no!\", \"That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. \", \"How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!\", \"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?\", \"It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.\", \"You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\", \"Oh, he excels at that, sir.\", \"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.\", \"Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?\", \"I think so.\", \"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.\", \"Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\", \"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.\", \"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?\", \"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.\", \"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.\", \"No, he's not going to try anything.\", \"What's wrong with him now?\", \"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\", \"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.\", \"Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.\", \"Don't worry, he'll be all right.\", \"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.\", \"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?\", \"I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.\", \"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.\", \"You know him!\", \"I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\", \"Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...\", \"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.\", \"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?\", \"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\", \"That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\", \"I wish I'd known him.\", \"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...\", \"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. \", \"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.\", \"What is it?\", \"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.\", \"I seem to have found it.\", \"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.\", \"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.\", \"That's your uncle talking.\", \"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?\", \"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.\", \"The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....\", \"That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\", \"They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.\", \"Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\", \"Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!\", \"Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.\", \"How long have you had these droids?\", \"They're for sale if you want them.\", \"Let me see your identification.\", \"These are not the droids we're looking for.\", \"He can go about his business.\", \"You can go about your business.\", \"Move along.\", \"Move along.  Move along.\", \"I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.\", \"Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?\", \"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.\", \"What?\", \"He doesn't like you.\", \"Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.\", \"This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.\", \"I don't like the look of this.\", \"Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.\", \"Should I have?\", \"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?\", \"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.\", \"What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\", \"Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\", \"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.\", \"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?\", \"You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...\", \"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\", \"Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.\", \"Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.\", \"Going somewhere, Solo?\", \"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.\", \"Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?\", \"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\", \"Over my dead body.\", \"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.\", \"You watch your language!\", \"He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they \", \"It will be enough.\", \"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.\", \"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.\", \"You sent Greedo to blast me.\", \"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\", \"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.\", \"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\", \"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.\", \"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\", \"Blast 'em!\", \"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.\", \"It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.\", \"Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.\", \"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!\", \"How long before you can make the jump to light speed?\", \"What's that flashing?\", \"Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\", \"What?\", \"You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. \", \"No!\", \"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.\", \"Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.\", \"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\", \"That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.\", \"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.\", \"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\", \"It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\", \"With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?\", \"You see, you can do it.\", \"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.\", \"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.\", \"Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.\", \"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.\", \"That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.\", \"Yes.\", \"I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.\", \"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.\", \"What's going on?\", \"What?  How?\", \"Maybe they know what happened.\", \"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.\", \"Not for long...\", \"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...\", \"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.\", \"Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.\", \"I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.\", \"I have a very bad feeling about this.\", \"We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!\", \"Yes.\", \"Did you find any droids?\", \"Yes, sir.\", \"I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...\", \"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.\", \"Leave that to me!\", \"Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!\", \"Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?\", \"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?\", \"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.\", \"Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.\", \"I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.\", \"I want to go with you.\", \"But he can...\", \"Where did you dig up that old fossil?\", \"Ben is a great man.\", \"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.\", \"I didn't hear you give any ideas...\", \"Who do you think...\", \"What is it?\", \"Well, who... who has he found?\", \"The princess?  She's here?\", \"Where... where is she?\", \"Princess?  What's going on?\", \"The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.\", \"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.\", \"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?\", \"They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. \", \"But they're going to kill her!\", \"She's rich.\", \"Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...\", \"What?\", \"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!\", \"You will...\", \"What's your plan?\", \"Okay.  Han, you put these on.\", \"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.\", \"That isn't very reassuring.\", \"I can't see a thing in this helmet.\", \"This is not going to work.\", \"Why didn't you say so before?\", \"Where are you taking this... thing?\", \"Look out!  He's loose!\", \"He's going to pull us all apart.\", \"Go get him!\", \"Who is this?  What's your operating number?\", \"Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!\", \"Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?\", \"You're who?\", \"I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.\", \"He is here...\", \"A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.\", \"Surely he must be dead by now.\", \"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.\", \"Yes.\", \"Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.\", \"Get behind me!  Get behind me!\", \"Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.\", \"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.\", \"Yes sir?\", \"We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!\", \"Oh, no!\", \"There isn't any other way out.\", \"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?\", \"He's the brains, sweetheart.\", \"Well, I didn't...\", \"Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy.\", \"Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...\", \"No!  wait!\", \"Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.\", \"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.\", \"That's your imagination.\", \"Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?\", \"What?\", \"Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.\", \"Where?\", \"Anywhere!  Oh!!\", \"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...\", \"Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.\", \"Wait a minute!\", \"Take over!See to him!  Look there!\", \"Get to the top!\", \"I can't \", \"One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!\", \"Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?\", \"Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!\", \"No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!\", \"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!\", \"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?\", \"Where are you going?\", \"No, wait.  They'll hear!\", \"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?\", \"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!\", \"It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?\", \"Do you know what's going on?\", \"What was that?\", \"There she is.\", \"You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.\", \"It's them!  Blast them!\", \"I think we took a wrong turn.\", \"Oh, I think I just blasted it.\", \"Where could they be?\", \"Open the blast doors!  Open the blast doors!\", \"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.\", \"Only a master of evil, Darth.\", \"Your powers are weak, old man.\", \"Didn't we just leave this party?\", \"We ran into some old friends.\", \"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.\", \"Look!\", \"Come on, Artoo, we're going!\", \"No!\", \"Blast the door!  Kid!\", \"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!\", \"I can't believe he's gone.\", \"There wasn't anything you could have done.\", \"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!\", \"You hear me, baby?  Hold together!\", \"There are still two more of them out there!\", \"That's it!  We did it!\", \"We did it!\", \"Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.\", \"They have just made the jump into hyperspace.\", \"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.\", \"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.\", \"At least the information in Artoo is still intact.\", \"What's so important?  What's he carrying?\", \"Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.\", \"So... what do you think of her, Han?\", \"Good...\", \"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...\", \"No!\", \"You're safe!  We had feared the worst.\", \"Yes.\", \"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\", \"That's impossible, even for a computer.\", \"So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?\", \"That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.\", \"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.\", \"What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.\", \"What's wrong?\", \"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. \", \"He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.\", \"Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!\", \"Thank you, sir.  I'll try.\", \"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.\", \"You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!\", \"This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?\", \"Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?\", \"Okay, easy she goes!\", \"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?\", \"Look at the size of that thing!\", \"I see it.  Stay low. \", \"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.\", \"Luke, let me know when you're going in.\", \"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way.\", \"Biggs!  You've picked one up... watch it!\", \"I can't see it!  Where is he?!\", \"He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.\", \"Blast it!  Wedge where are you?\", \"Good shooting, Wedge!\", \"How many guns do you think, Gold Five?\", \"Stabilize your rear deflectors.  Watch for enemy fighters.\", \"Yes, sir.\", \"They came from behind....\", \"We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.  Should I have your ship standing by?\", \"Evacuate?  In out moment of triumph?  I think you overestimate their chances!\", \"This is it!\", \"Keep your eyes open for those fighters!\", \"No sign of any... wait!\", \"I see them.\", \"Almost there!\", \"Almost there!\", \"Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.\", \"... oh-five; we'll cover for you.\", \"Stay there...\", \"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle.\", \"It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.\", \"We'll stay back far enough to cover you.\", \"Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!\", \"Get clear, Wedge.\", \"You can't do any more good back there!\", \"Let him go!  Stay on the leader!\", \"Wait!\", \"Nothing.  I'm all right.\", \"I have you now.\", \"What?\", \"Look out!\", \"You're all clear, kid.\", \"Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million.\", \"Hey!

What course shall we set?\", \"I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.\", \"I expected you would be.\", \"Which way?\", \"Stop that ship!\", \"Here's where the fun begins!\", \"It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.\", \"Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...\", \"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\", \"to take the responsibility yourself!\", \"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\", \"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\", \"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.\", \"You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\", \"I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\", \"Dantooine.\", \"They're on Dantooine.\", \"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.\", \"I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.\", \"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\", \"Stretch out with your feelings.\", \"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\", \"Terminate her... immediately!\", \"Destroyed... by the Empire!\", \"The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...\", \"There's another ship coming in.\", \"It followed us!\", \"No.  It's a short range fighter.\", \"It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\", \"A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.\", \"That's no moon!  It's a space station.\", \"It's too big to be a space station.\", \"Turn the ship around!\", \"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.\", \"You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.\", \"To your stations!\", \"Close all outboard shields!  Close all outboard shields!\", \"We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.\", \"They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.\", \"Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.\", \"Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!\", \"He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.\", \"The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.\", \"Princess Leia.\", \"Princess?\", \"Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.\", \"Everything is under control.  Situation normal.\", \"What happened?\", \"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.\", \"The princess!  Put all sections on alert!\", \"Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.\", \"Can't get out that way.\", \"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.\", \"What the hell are you doing?\", \"What happened?\", \"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.\", \"They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.\", \"Secure this area until the alert is canceled.\", \"Maybe it's another drill.\", \"For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.\", \"Get back to the ship!\", \"He certainly has courage.\", \"They're coming through!\", \"Close the blast doors!\", \"We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!\", \"They're coming in too fast!\", \"Oooh!\", \"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.\", \"Easy... you call that easy?\", \"Not this ship, sister.\", \"The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!\", \"We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.\", \"We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.\", \"The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.\", \"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.\", \"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\", \"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.\", \"It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.\", \"Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\", \"All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.\", \"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.\", \"Stand-by alert.  Death Star approaching.

This is it, boys!\", \"We're starting for the target shaft now.\", \"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!\", \"We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.\", \"Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.\", \"Watch your back!

It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..\", \"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.\", \"Did I hear a young noise blast through here?\", \"It was just Wormie on another rampage.\", \"I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?\", \"Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. \", \"The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?\", \"I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!\", \"There they are!\", \"But there was a lot of firing earlier...\", \"I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...\", \"you anything.\", \"Yes, sir.\", \"How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.\", \"What a desolate place this is.\", \"Where are you going?\", \"What makes you think there are settlements over there?\", \"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.\", \"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.\", \"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.\", \"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.\", \"Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...\", \"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.\", \"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.\", \"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...\", \"My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.\", \"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. \", \"I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.\", \"Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.\", \"Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.\", \"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.\", \"I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.\", \"Things always change.\", \"I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? \", \"Look, sir - droids.\", \"Do you think they'll melt us down?\", \"It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.\", \"I have no need for a protocol droid.\", \"Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...\", \"What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.\", \"Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...\", \"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...\", \"Uncle Owen...\", \"This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!\", \"Hey, what're you trying to push on us?\", \"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.\", \"Uncle Owen...\", \"What about that one?\", \"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.\", \"Okay, let's go.\", \"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!\", \"It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!\", \"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.\", \"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.\", \"You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?\", \"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.\", \"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.\", \"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...\", \"What's this?\", \"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.\", \"Who is she?  She's beautiful.\", \"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...\", \"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.\", \"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.\", \"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?\", \"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.\", \"I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.\", \"H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.\", \"There you go.\", \"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.\", \"been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! \", \"Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\", \"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\", \"What makes you think that?\", \"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.\", \"That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.\", \"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.\", \"I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\", \"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\", \"Sure, there're more than enough droids.\", \"But it's a whole 'nother year.\", \"Look, it's only one more season.\", \"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\", \"Where are you going?\", \"It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.\", \"Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.\", \"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.\", \"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\", \"Oh, no!\", \"That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. \", \"How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!\", \"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?\", \"It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.\", \"You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\", \"Oh, he excels at that, sir.\", \"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.\", \"Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?\", \"I think so.\", \"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.\", \"Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\", \"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.\", \"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?\", \"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.\", \"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.\", \"No, he's not going to try anything.\", \"What's wrong with him now?\", \"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\", \"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.\", \"Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.\", \"Don't worry, he'll be all right.\", \"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.\", \"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?\", \"I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.\", \"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.\", \"You know him!\", \"I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\", \"Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...\", \"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.\", \"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?\", \"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\", \"That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\", \"I wish I'd known him.\", \"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...\", \"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. \", \"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.\", \"What is it?\", \"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.\", \"I seem to have found it.\", \"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.\", \"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.\", \"That's your uncle talking.\", \"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?\", \"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.\", \"The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....\", \"That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\", \"They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.\", \"Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\", \"Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!\", \"Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.\", \"How long have you had these droids?\", \"They're for sale if you want them.\", \"Let me see your identification.\", \"These are not the droids we're looking for.\", \"He can go about his business.\", \"You can go about your business.\", \"Move along.\", \"Move along.  Move along.\", \"I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.\", \"Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?\", \"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.\", \"What?\", \"He doesn't like you.\", \"Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.\", \"This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.\", \"I don't like the look of this.\", \"Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.\", \"Should I have?\", \"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?\", \"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.\", \"What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\", \"Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\", \"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.\", \"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?\", \"You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...\", \"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\", \"Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.\", \"Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.\", \"Going somewhere, Solo?\", \"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.\", \"Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?\", \"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\", \"Over my dead body.\", \"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.\", \"You watch your language!\", \"He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they \", \"It will be enough.\", \"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.\", \"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.\", \"You sent Greedo to blast me.\", \"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\", \"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.\", \"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\", \"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.\", \"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\", \"Blast 'em!\", \"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.\", \"It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.\", \"Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.\", \"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!\", \"How long before you can make the jump to light speed?\", \"What's that flashing?\", \"Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\", \"What?\", \"You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. \", \"No!\", \"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.\", \"Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.\", \"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\", \"That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.\", \"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.\", \"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\", \"It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\", \"With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?\", \"You see, you can do it.\", \"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.\", \"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.\", \"Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.\", \"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.\", \"That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.\", \"Yes.\", \"I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.\", \"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.\", \"What's going on?\", \"What?  How?\", \"Maybe they know what happened.\", \"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.\", \"Not for long...\", \"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...\", \"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.\", \"Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.\", \"I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.\", \"I have a very bad feeling about this.\", \"We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!\", \"Yes.\", \"Did you find any droids?\", \"Yes, sir.\", \"I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...\", \"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.\", \"Leave that to me!\", \"Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!\", \"Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?\", \"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?\", \"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.\", \"Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.\", \"I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.\", \"I want to go with you.\", \"But he can...\", \"Where did you dig up that old fossil?\", \"Ben is a great man.\", \"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.\", \"I didn't hear you give any ideas...\", \"Who do you think...\", \"What is it?\", \"Well, who... who has he found?\", \"The princess?  She's here?\", \"Where... where is she?\", \"Princess?  What's going on?\", \"The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.\", \"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.\", \"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?\", \"They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. \", \"But they're going to kill her!\", \"She's rich.\", \"Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...\", \"What?\", \"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!\", \"You will...\", \"What's your plan?\", \"Okay.  Han, you put these on.\", \"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.\", \"That isn't very reassuring.\", \"I can't see a thing in this helmet.\", \"This is not going to work.\", \"Why didn't you say so before?\", \"Where are you taking this... thing?\", \"Look out!  He's loose!\", \"He's going to pull us all apart.\", \"Go get him!\", \"Who is this?  What's your operating number?\", \"Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!\", \"Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?\", \"You're who?\", \"I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.\", \"He is here...\", \"A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.\", \"Surely he must be dead by now.\", \"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.\", \"Yes.\", \"Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.\", \"Get behind me!  Get behind me!\", \"Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.\", \"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.\", \"Yes sir?\", \"We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!\", \"Oh, no!\", \"There isn't any other way out.\", \"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?\", \"He's the brains, sweetheart.\", \"Well, I didn't...\", \"Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy.\", \"Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...\", \"No!  wait!\", \"Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.\", \"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.\", \"That's your imagination.\", \"Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?\", \"What?\", \"Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.\", \"Where?\", \"Anywhere!  Oh!!\", \"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...\", \"Don't just stand there.

I forgot I turned it off!\", \"No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!\", \"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!\", \"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?\", \"Where are you going?\", \"No, wait.  They'll hear!\", \"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?\", \"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!\", \"It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?\", \"Do you know what's going on?\", \"What was that?\", \"There she is.\", \"You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.\", \"It's them!  Blast them!\", \"I think we took a wrong turn.\", \"Oh, I think I just blasted it.\", \"Where could they be?\", \"Open the blast doors!  Open the blast doors!\", \"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.\", \"Only a master of evil, Darth.\", \"Your powers are weak, old man.\", \"Didn't we just leave this party?\", \"We ran into some old friends.\", \"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.\", \"Look!\", \"Come on, Artoo, we're going!\", \"No!\", \"Blast the door!  Kid!\", \"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!\", \"I can't believe he's gone.\", \"There wasn't anything you could have done.\", \"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!\", \"You hear me, baby?  Hold together!\", \"There are still two more of them out there!\", \"That's it!  We did it!\", \"We did it!\", \"Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.\", \"They have just made the jump into hyperspace.\", \"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.\", \"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.\", \"At least the information in Artoo is still intact.\", \"What's so important?  What's he carrying?\", \"Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.\", \"So... what do you think of her, Han?\", \"Good...\", \"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...\", \"No!\", \"You're safe!  We had feared the worst.\", \"Yes.\", \"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\", \"That's impossible, even for a computer.\", \"So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?\", \"That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.\", \"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.

I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. \", \"He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.\", \"Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!\", \"Thank you, sir.  I'll try.\", \"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.\", \"You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!\", \"This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?\", \"Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?\", \"Okay, easy she goes!\", \"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?\", \"Look at the size of that thing!\", \"I see it.  Stay low. \", \"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.\", \"Luke, let me know when you're going in.\", \"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.

Wedge where are you?\", \"Good shooting, Wedge!\", \"How many guns do you think, Gold Five?\", \"Stabilize your rear deflectors.  Watch for enemy fighters.\", \"Yes, sir.\", \"They came from behind....\", \"We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.  Should I have your ship standing by?\", \"Evacuate?  In out moment of triumph?  I think you overestimate their chances!\", \"This is it!\", \"Keep your eyes open for those fighters!\", \"No sign of any... wait!\", \"I see them.\", \"Almost there!\", \"Almost there!\", \"Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.\", \"... oh-five; we'll cover for you.\", \"Stay there...\", \"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.

The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...\", \"Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.\", \"You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!\", \"Holding her is dangerous.

Now she is my only link to find their secret base!\", \"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.\", \"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.\", \"Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?\", \"It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.

He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\", \"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!\", \"What happened?\", \"Quickly, son... they're on the move.\", \"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\", \"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.\", \"Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.\", \"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!\", \"The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.\", \"And what of the Rebellion?

This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!\", \"Enough of this!  Vader, release him!\", \"This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.

He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\", \"Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.\", \"The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.

I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\", \"to take the responsibility yourself!\", \"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\", \"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\", \"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.\", \"You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\", \"I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\", \"Dantooine.\", \"They're on Dantooine.\", \"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.\", \"I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.\", \"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\", \"Stretch out with your feelings.\", \"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\", \"Terminate her... immediately!\", \"Destroyed... by the Empire!\", \"The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...\", \"There's another ship coming in.\", \"It followed us!\", \"No.  It's a short range fighter.\", \"It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\", \"A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.\", \"That's no moon!

The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.\", \"What the hell are you doing?\", \"What happened?\", \"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.\", \"They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.

We are preparing to orbit the planet.\", \"The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.\", \"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.\", \"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\", \"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.\", \"It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.\", \"Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\", \"All flight troops, man your stations.

This is it, boys!\", \"We're starting for the target shaft now.\", \"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!\", \"We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.\", \"Keep up your visual scanning.

          "Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle.",
          "What about that tower?",

          "The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.",
          "If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?",
          "She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.",
          "Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.",
          "Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier.",
          "No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.",
          "I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...",
          "I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...",
          "I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.",
          "It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.",
          "Then I guess I won't see you.",

          "Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!",
          "Is there more to this recording?",
          "He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.",
          "I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.",
          "You mean the next semester before harvest?",
          "Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.",
          "What are you doing hiding there?",
          "I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.",
          "I find your lack of faith disturbing.",
          "Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!",
          "I'm sorry.",
          "You'll be dead.",
          "Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.",
          "Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!",
          "Seventeen, huh!",
          "You'll have to sell your speeder.",
          "It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.",
          "Over my dead body.",
          "Sorry about the mess.",
          "What do you mean?",
          "Lock the door, Artoo.",
          "Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",
          "Which way?",
          "It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.",
          "How long before you can make the jump to light speed?",
          "It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.",
          "We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.",
          "The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.",
          "I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.",
          "You mean it controls your actions?",
          "She lied!  She lied to us!",
          "Terminate her... immediately!",
          "What do you mean?  Where is it?",
          "Destroyed... by the Empire!",
          "No.  It's a short range fighter.",
          "Turn the ship around!",
          "We found the computer outlet, sir.",
          "Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.",
          "They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!",
          "You'll get it!",
          "Lock the door!",
          "This is not going to work.",
          "Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.",
          "Surely he must be dead by now.",
          "Can't get out that way.",
          "I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.",
          "I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?",
          "What the hell are you doing?",
          "Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you?  Do you copy?",
          "Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.",
          "Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.",
          "Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!",
          "For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.",
          "I think we took a wrong turn.",
          "That oughta hold it for a while.",
          "Here, hold this.",
          "Now's our chance!  Go!",
          "We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!",
          "Don't worry, she'll hold together.",
          "You hear me, baby?  Hold together!",
          "At least the information in Artoo is still intact.",
          "The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.",
          "What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.",
          "Stand-by alert.  Death Star approaching.  Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.",
          "Hold tight!",
          "Switch your deflectors on.",
          "Accelerate to attack speed.  This is it, boys!",
          "Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way.",
          "My scope's negative.  I don't see anything.",
          "Several fighters have broken off from the main group.  Come with me!",
          "Hold on!",
          "... marked and locked in!",
          "Switch power to front deflection screens.",

          "Rendezvous at mark six point one.",
          "We should be able to see it by now.",
          "Just hold them off for a few seconds.",
          "I can't hold them!",
          "Negative.",
          "Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?",
          "Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!",

          "Sorry!",
          "Artoo, try and increase the power!",
          "The Death Star has cleared the planet.  The Death Star has cleared the planet.",

          "Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?",
          "Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.",
          "Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.",
          "No, I'm leaving in the morning...",
          "Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!",
          "Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...",
          "And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.",
          "Hello.",
          "Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.",
          "It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.",
          "Have you seen Luke this morning?",
          "How's that.",
          "There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.",
          "I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.",
          "... Threepio!",
          "Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.",
          "Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.",
          "Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.",
          "A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",
          "Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.",
          "I saw part of the message he was...",
          "It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.",
          "They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.",
          "These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.",
          "And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.",
          "Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.",
          "Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?",
          "No blasters!  No blaster!",
          "Yes, I'll bet you have.",
          "The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?",
          "Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.",
          "You watch your language!",
          "Hello, sir.",
          "Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...",
          "to take the responsibility yourself!",
          "Commence primary ignition.",
          "Now be careful, Artoo.",
          "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",
          "Yes.",
          "Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.",
          "A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.",
          "Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.",
          "Yes.",
          "Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...",
          "We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.",
          "The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.",
          "Yes.",
          "See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!",
          "Yes sir?",
          "We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!",
          "No!  wait!",
          "Wait a minute!",
          "Threepio!  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?",
          "Follow me!  You stand guard.",
          "Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.",
          "Threepio!  Come in, Threepio!  Threepio!",
          "Where could he be?  Threepio!  Threepio, will you come in?",

          "See-Threepio, do you copy?",
          "We're right above you.  Stand by.",
          "Only a master of evil, Darth.",
          "You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.",
          "We've lost lateral controls.",
          "Yes.",
          "Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.",
          "So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?",
          "He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.",
          "Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.",
          "We're passing through their magnetic field.",
          "I copy, Gold Leader.",
          "Biggs!  You've picked one up... watch it!",
          "Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.",
          "Artoo, see what you can do with it.  Hang on back there.",
          "Thanks, Wedge.",
          "I copy, Gold Leader.  Move into position.",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "I copy, Gold Five.",

          "Who is she?  She's beautiful.",
          "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...",
          "Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.",
          "been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! ",
          "Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!",
          "Just you reconsider playing that message for him.",
          "No, I don't think he likes you at all.",
          "What makes you think that?",
          "He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.",
          "Sure, there're more than enough droids.",
          "Where are you going?",
          "Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.",
          "Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.",
          "You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.",
          "Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!",
          "I think so.",
          "Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!",
          "Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.",
          "Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...",
          "Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?",
          "Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.",
          "Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.",
          "The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?",
          "No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?",
          "Quickly, son... they're on the move.",
          "Sure, go ahead.",
          "The Force?",
          "General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.",
          "You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.",
          "Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.",
          "I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.",
          "Learn about the Force, Luke.",
          "Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.",
          "I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.",
          "Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.",
          "Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?",
          "Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.",
          "This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...",
          "This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.",
          "What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?",
          "Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.",
          "Going somewhere, Solo?",
          "Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.",
          "I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...",
          "Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.",
          "Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?",
          "You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.",
          "I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.",
          "I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.",
          "Come on out, Solo!",
          "I've been waiting for you, Jabba.",
          "You sent Greedo to blast me.",
          "Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.",
          "I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.",
          "What a piece of junk.",
          "We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.",
          "Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.",
          "Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!",
          "We've entered the Alderaan system.",
          "Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",
          "No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...",
          "Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.",
          "I suggest you try it again, Luke.",
          "Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!",
          "Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.",
          "It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.",
          "Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.",
          "I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.",
          "Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.",
          "There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!",
          "We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.",
          "Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!",
          "I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.",
          "Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.",
          "Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.",
          "Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...",
          "Who do you think...",
          "The princess?  She's here?",
          "Princess?  What's going on?",
          "The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.",
          "I'm not going anywhere.",
          "But they're going to kill her!",
          "Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you.",
          "And hope they don't have blasters.",
          "Why didn't you say so before?",
          "Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!",
          "What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. ",
          "You're who?",
          "Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?",
          "Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.",
          "There isn't any other way out.",
          "This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?",
          "Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!",
          "Help!",
          "Luke!  Luke!  Luke!",
          "Luke!",
          "Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.",
          "Luke!  Luke!",
          "They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.",
          "Hurry!",
          "One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!",
          "No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!",
          "If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.",
          "Where are you going?",
          "Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?",
          "You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.",
          "Where are you going?  Come back!",
          "Oh, I think I just blasted it.",
          "I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete.",
          "Didn't we just leave this party?",
          "Come on, Artoo, we're going!",
          "There wasn't anything you could have done.",
          "You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!",
          "Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.",
          "They have just made the jump into hyperspace.",
          "Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...",
          "You're safe!  We had feared the worst.",
          "Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!",
          "Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!",
          "Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...",
          "Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?",
          "Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.",
          "I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?",
          "Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?",
          "Luke, the Force will be with you.",
          "Lock S-foils in attack position.",
          "We're in position.  I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.",
          "I see it.  Stay low. ",
          "This is Red Five!  I'm going in!",
          "Luke, pull up!",
          "Luke, let me know when you're going in.",
          "I'm on my way in now...",
          "I'm on it.",
          "Watch your back, Luke!",
          "I'm on him, Luke!",
          "Stay in attack formation!",
          "They came from behind....",
          "I'm in range.",
          "Stay there...",
          "It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.",
          "We'll stay back far enough to cover you.",
          "I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.",
          "Let him go!  Stay on the leader!",
          "Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them!",
          "Hurry up, Luke!",
          "Use the Force, Luke.",
          "Let go, Luke.",

          "If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.",
          "I wish I'd known him.",
          "Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.",
          "Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!",
          "The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.",
          "The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.",
          "The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.",
          "Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!",
          "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.",
          "Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...",
          "Enough of this!  Vader, release him!",
          "As you wish.",
          "This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.",
          "Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?",
          "About three or four seasons.",
          "Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?",
          "It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!",
          "Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.",
          "Ninety-four.",
          "Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.",
          "If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.",
          "Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",
          "There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",
          "I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.",
          "Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.",
          "Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...",
          "It's too big to be a space station.",
          "Why are we still moving towards it?",
          "You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.",
          "To your stations!",
          "They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.",
          "Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?",
          "Ben is a great man.",
          "I didn't hear you give any ideas...",
          "Princess Leia.",
          "Princess?",
          "What are you talking about?",
          "Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.",
          "Everything is under control.  Situation normal.",
          "The princess!  Put all sections on alert!",
          "Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.",
          "Open up in there!",
          "Grab him!",
          "The walls are moving!",
          "They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.",
          "I'm trying!",
          "Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!",
          "Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?",
          "No, wait.  They'll hear!",
          "Secure this area until the alert is canceled.",
          "Run, Luke!  Run!",
          "Oooh!",
          "Are they away?",
          "You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.",
          "That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.",
          "Easy... you call that easy?",
          "Their tracking us!",
          "The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!",
          "When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.",
          "We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.",
          "Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.",
          "Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!",
          "All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.",
          "What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.",
          "Okay, easy she goes!",
          "We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!",
          "... This is Gold Leader.  We're starting out attack run.",
          "They've coming in!  Three marks at two ten.",
          "Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.",
          "We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.  Should I have your ship standing by?",
          "It's away!",
          "... I just lost my starboard engine.",
          "Get set up for your attack run.",
          "Hey!  Hey!",
          "Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.",
          "We'll get to work on him right away."

          "That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.",
          "I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?",
          "Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.",
          "I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!",
          "How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.",
          "What a desolate place this is.",
          "Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.",
          "I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.",
          "I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? ",
          "Look, sir - droids.",
          "Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?",
          "Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...",
          "Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...",
          "Shutting up, sir.",
          "But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...",
          "You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!",
          "This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!",
          "What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.",
          "I see, sir.",
          "You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.",
          "Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.",
          "He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",
          "I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?",
          "Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.",
          "You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",
          "I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.",
          "That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.",
          "Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.",
          "Look, it's only one more season.",
          "Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.",
          "It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.",
          "Oh, no!",
          "That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. ",
          "How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!",
          "Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?",
          "Oh, he excels at that, sir.",
          "He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.",
          "Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?",
          "Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.",
          "No, he's not going to try anything.",
          "Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.",
          "What happened?",
          "Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?",
          "Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.",
          "Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.",
          "You know him!",
          "Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.",
          "I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.",
          "I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",
          "An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.",
          "That's your uncle talking.",
          "Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?",
          "If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!",
          "And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.",
          "How long have you had these droids?",
          "Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.",
          "We don't serve their kind here!",
          "Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.",
          "I heartily agree with you sir.",
          "Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.",
          "We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",
          "Yeah, but this time I got the money.",
          "You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.",
          "Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!",
          "I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?",
          "Dantooine.",
          "You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. ",
          "Don't everyone thank me at once.",
          "Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.",
          "But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.",
          "That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.",
          "It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.",
          "Stretch out with your feelings.",
          "You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.",
          "Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.",
          "What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.",
          "Maybe they know what happened.",
          "Not for long...",
          "Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.",
          "That's no moon!  It's a space station.",
          "Did you find any droids?",
          "I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...",
          "You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.",
          "Where did you dig up that old fossil?",
          "Oh, no!  We've got to do something.",
          "Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.",
          "But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?",
          "I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!",
          "Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.",
          "Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?",
          "That isn't very reassuring.",
          "I did say so before!",
          "Look out!  He's loose!",
          "He's going to pull us all apart.",
          "What happened?",
          "I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.",
          "A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.",
          "Oh, no!",
          "He's the brains, sweetheart.",
          "Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.",
          "That's your imagination.",
          "Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?",
          "Anywhere!  Oh!!",
          "What happened?",
          "I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...",
          "Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.",
          "Take over!See to him!  Look there!",
          "Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?",
          "Are you there, sir?",
          "We're all right.  You did great.",
          "Do you know what's going on?",
          "Maybe it's another drill.",
          "Oh, it's nothing.  Don't worry about it.",
          "When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.",
          "What kept you?",
          "We ran into some old friends.",
          "Look!",
          "I can't believe he's gone.",
          "That's it!  We did it!",
          "We did it!",
          "Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.",
          "You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!",
          "We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.",
          "Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?",
          "Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.",
          "This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.",
          "Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. ",
          "Thank you, sir.  I'll try.",
          "You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!",
          "This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?",
          "You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?",
          "He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.",
          "Pull in!  Luke... pull in!",
          "I can't shake him!",
          "Rebel base, three minutes and closing.",
          "... oh-five; we'll cover for you.",
          "Rebel base, one minute and closing.",
          "Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.",
          "Rebel base, in range.",
          "Look out!",
          "Stand by to fire at Rebel base.",
          "Oh, no!"

          "I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. ",

          "All right; shut up! I'll take this one.",

          "Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!",
          "It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!",
          "With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.",

          "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",
          "I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...",
          "All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.",
          "Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.",
          "But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?",
          "I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.",
          "You must understand I need you here, Luke.",
          "I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.",

          "That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.",
          "Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.",
          "That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?",
          "They're for sale if you want them.",

          "Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.",
          "All right, we'll check it out.",
          "Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.",
          "If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.",
          "That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.",
          "With pleasure.",

          "I'm not the type to run.",
          "Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.",
          "Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.",
          "Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.",
          "All right, men.  Load your weapons!",

          "There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.",
          "Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.",
          "Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!",
          "Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.",
          "Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.",
          "Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.",
          "I want to go with you.",
          "Boy you said it, Chewie.",
          "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \"I found her,\" and keepsrepeating, \"She's here.\"",
          "Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.",
          "They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. ",
          "All right.",
          "Okay.  Han, you put these on.",
          "I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.",
          "Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?",
          "Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.",
          "If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.",
          "Chewie!",
          "Well, I didn't...",
          "Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!",
          "All right.",
          "Get back to the ship!",
          "He certainly has courage.",
          "Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the control that extends the bridge.",
          "Is the ship all right?",
          "Not this ship, sister.",
          "It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!",
          "Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.",
          "So... what do you think of her, Han?",
          "That's impossible, even for a computer.",
          "It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.",
          "All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?",
          "I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.",
          "I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.",
          "Double front!",
          "Heavy fire, boss!  Twenty-threedegrees.",
          "Are you all right?",

I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.\", \"But there was a lot of firing earlier...\", \"I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...\", \"Where are you going?\", \"What makes you think there are settlements over there?\", \"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.\", \"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!\", \"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.\", \"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.\", \"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.\", \"And I'm stuck here...\", \"So long, Luke.\", \"Wake up!  Wake up!\", \"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\", \"Do you speak Bocce?\", \"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.\", \"Yeah?\", \"Yeah?\", \"Is there anything I might do to help? \", \"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.\", \"Uh, you can call me Luke.\", \"I see, sir Luke.\", \"Just Luke.\", \"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.\", \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope.\", \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.\", \"Who is she?  She's beautiful.\", \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\", \"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.\", \"been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! \", \"Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!\", \"Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\", \"No, I don't think he likes you at all.\", \"What makes you think that?\", \"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.\", \"Sure, there're more than enough droids.\", \"Where are you going?\", \"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.\", \"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.\", \"You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\", \"Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!\", \"I think so.\", \"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!\", \"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.\", \"Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\", \"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?\", \"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.\", \"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.\", \"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?\", \"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?\", \"Quickly, son... they're on the move.\", \"Sure, go ahead.\", \"The Force?\", \"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\", \"You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.\", \"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.\", \"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.\", \"Learn about the Force, Luke.\", \"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.\", \"I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.\", \"Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.\", \"Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?\", \"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.\", \"This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...\", \"This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.\", \"What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\", \"Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\", \"Going somewhere, Solo?\", \"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.\", \"I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...\", \"Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\", \"Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?\", \"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\", \"I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.\", \"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.\", \"Come on out, Solo!\", \"I've been waiting for you, Jabba.\", \"You sent Greedo to blast me.\", \"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\", \"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.\", \"What a piece of junk.\", \"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.\", \"Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.\", \"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!\", \"We've entered the Alderaan system.\", \"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.\", \"No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...\", \"Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.\", \"I suggest you try it again, Luke.\", \"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!\", \"Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.\", \"It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\", \"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.\", \"I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.\", \"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.\", \"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!\", \"We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.\", \"Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!\", \"I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.\", \"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.\", \"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.\", \"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...\", \"Who do you think...\", \"The princess?  She's here?\", \"Princess?  What's going on?\", \"The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.\", \"I'm not going anywhere.\", \"But they're going to kill her!\", \"Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you.\", \"And hope they don't have blasters.\", \"Why didn't you say so before?\", \"Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!\", \"What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. \", \"You're who?\", \"Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?\", \"Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.\", \"There isn't any other way out.\", \"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?\", \"Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!\", \"Help!\", \"Luke!  Luke!  Luke!\", \"Luke!\", \"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.\", \"Luke!  Luke!\", \"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.\", \"Hurry!\", \"One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!\", \"No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!\", \"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.\", \"Where are you going?\", \"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?\", \"You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.\", \"Where are you going?  Come back!\", \"Oh, I think I just blasted it.\", \"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete.\", \"Didn't we just leave this party?\", \"Come on, Artoo, we're going!\", \"There wasn't anything you could have done.\", \"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!\", \"Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.\", \"They have just made the jump into hyperspace.\", \"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...\", \"You're safe!  We had feared the worst.\", \"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!\", \"Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!\", \"Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...\", \"Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?\", \"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.\", \"I've got to get aboard.

Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.\", \"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.\", \"You know him!\", \"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\", \"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.\", \"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. \", \"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.\", \"That's your uncle talking.\", \"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?\", \"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!\", \"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.\", \"How long have you had these droids?\", \"Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.\", \"We don't serve their kind here!\", \"Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.\", \"I heartily agree with you sir.\", \"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.\", \"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\", \"Yeah, but this time I got the money.\", \"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.\", \"Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\", \"I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\", \"Dantooine.\", \"You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. \", \"Don't everyone thank me at once.\", \"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.\", \"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\", \"That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.\", \"It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\", \"Stretch out with your feelings.\", \"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.\", \"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\", \"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.\", \"Maybe they know what happened.\", \"Not for long...\", \"Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.\", \"That's no moon!  It's a space station.\", \"Did you find any droids?\", \"I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...\", \"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.\", \"Where did you dig up that old fossil?\", \"Oh, no!  We've got to do something.\", \"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.\", \"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?\", \"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!\", \"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.\", \"Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?\", \"That isn't very reassuring.\", \"I did say so before!\", \"Look out!  He's loose!\", \"He's going to pull us all apart.\", \"What happened?\", \"I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.\", \"A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.\", \"Oh, no!\", \"He's the brains, sweetheart.\", \"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.\", \"That's your imagination.\", \"Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?\", \"Anywhere!  Oh!!\", \"What happened?\", \"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...\", \"Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.\", \"Take over!See to him!  Look there!\", \"Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?\", \"Are you there, sir?\", \"We're all right.  You did great.\", \"Do you know what's going on?\", \"Maybe it's another drill.\", \"Oh, it's nothing.  Don't worry about it.\", \"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.\", \"What kept you?\", \"We ran into some old friends.\", \"Look!\", \"I can't believe he's gone.\", \"That's it!  We did it!\", \"We did it!\", \"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.\", \"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!\", \"We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.\", \"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\", \"Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\", \"This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.\", \"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. \", \"Thank you, sir.  I'll try.\", \"You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!\", \"This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?\", \"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?\", \"He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.\", \"Pull in!

I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.\", \"But there was a lot of firing earlier...\", \"I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...\", \"Where are you going?\", \"What makes you think there are settlements over there?\", \"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.\", \"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!\", \"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.\", \"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.\", \"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.\", \"And I'm stuck here...\", \"So long, Luke.\", \"Wake up!  Wake up!\", \"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\", \"Do you speak Bocce?\", \"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.\", \"Yeah?\", \"Yeah?\", \"Is there anything I might do to help? \", \"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.\", \"Uh, you can call me Luke.\", \"I see, sir Luke.\", \"Just Luke.\", \"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.\", \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope.\", \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.\", \"Who is she?  She's beautiful.\", \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\", \"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.\", \"been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! \", \"Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!\", \"Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\", \"No, I don't think he likes you at all.\", \"What makes you think that?\", \"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.\", \"Sure, there're more than enough droids.\", \"Where are you going?\", \"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.\", \"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.\", \"You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\", \"Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!\", \"I think so.\", \"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!\", \"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.\", \"Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\", \"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?\", \"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.\", \"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.\", \"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?\", \"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?\", \"Quickly, son... they're on the move.\", \"Sure, go ahead.\", \"The Force?\", \"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\", \"You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.\", \"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.\", \"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.\", \"Learn about the Force, Luke.\", \"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.\", \"I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.\", \"Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.\", \"Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?\", \"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.\", \"This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...\", \"This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.\", \"What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\", \"Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\", \"Going somewhere, Solo?\", \"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.\", \"I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...\", \"Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\", \"Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?\", \"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\", \"I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.\", \"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.\", \"Come on out, Solo!\", \"I've been waiting for you, Jabba.\", \"You sent Greedo to blast me.\", \"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\", \"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.\", \"What a piece of junk.\", \"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.\", \"Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.\", \"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!\", \"We've entered the Alderaan system.\", \"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.\", \"No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...\", \"Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.\", \"I suggest you try it again, Luke.\", \"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!\", \"Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.\", \"It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\", \"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.\", \"I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.\", \"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.\", \"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!\", \"We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.\", \"Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!\", \"I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.\", \"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.\", \"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.\", \"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...\", \"Who do you think...\", \"The princess?  She's here?\", \"Princess?  What's going on?\", \"The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.\", \"I'm not going anywhere.\", \"But they're going to kill her!\", \"Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you.\", \"And hope they don't have blasters.\", \"Why didn't you say so before?\", \"Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!\", \"What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. \", \"You're who?\", \"Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?\", \"Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.\", \"There isn't any other way out.\", \"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?\", \"Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!\", \"Help!\", \"Luke!  Luke!  Luke!\", \"Luke!\", \"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.\", \"Luke!  Luke!\", \"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.\", \"Hurry!\", \"One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!\", \"No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!\", \"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.\", \"Where are you going?\", \"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?\", \"You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.\", \"Where are you going?  Come back!\", \"Oh, I think I just blasted it.\", \"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete.\", \"Didn't we just leave this party?\", \"Come on, Artoo, we're going!\", \"There wasn't anything you could have done.\", \"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!\", \"Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.\", \"They have just made the jump into hyperspace.\", \"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...\", \"You're safe!  We had feared the worst.\", \"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!\", \"Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!\", \"Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...\", \"Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?\", \"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.\", \"I've got to get aboard.

Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.\", \"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.\", \"You know him!\", \"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\", \"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.\", \"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. \", \"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.\", \"That's your uncle talking.\", \"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?\", \"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!\", \"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.\", \"How long have you had these droids?\", \"Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.\", \"We don't serve their kind here!\", \"Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.\", \"I heartily agree with you sir.\", \"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.\", \"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\", \"Yeah, but this time I got the money.\", \"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.\", \"Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\", \"I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\", \"Dantooine.\", \"You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. \", \"Don't everyone thank me at once.\", \"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.\", \"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\", \"That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.\", \"It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\", \"Stretch out with your feelings.\", \"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.\", \"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\", \"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.\", \"Maybe they know what happened.\", \"Not for long...\", \"Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.\", \"That's no moon!  It's a space station.\", \"Did you find any droids?\", \"I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...\", \"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.\", \"Where did you dig up that old fossil?\", \"Oh, no!  We've got to do something.\", \"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.\", \"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?\", \"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!\", \"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.\", \"Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?\", \"That isn't very reassuring.\", \"I did say so before!\", \"Look out!  He's loose!\", \"He's going to pull us all apart.\", \"What happened?\", \"I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.\", \"A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.\", \"Oh, no!\", \"He's the brains, sweetheart.\", \"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.\", \"That's your imagination.\", \"Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?\", \"Anywhere!  Oh!!\", \"What happened?\", \"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...\", \"Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.\", \"Take over!See to him!  Look there!\", \"Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?\", \"Are you there, sir?\", \"We're all right.  You did great.\", \"Do you know what's going on?\", \"Maybe it's another drill.\", \"Oh, it's nothing.  Don't worry about it.\", \"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.\", \"What kept you?\", \"We ran into some old friends.\", \"Look!\", \"I can't believe he's gone.\", \"That's it!  We did it!\", \"We did it!\", \"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.\", \"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!\", \"We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.\", \"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\", \"Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\", \"This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.\", \"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. \", \"Thank you, sir.  I'll try.\", \"You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!\", \"This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?\", \"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?\", \"He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.\", \"Pull in!
